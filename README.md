# Combinatorics

This isn't my work, all credit goes to Phillip M. Feldman [[Homepage](https://phillipmfeldman.org/index.html)].

I made this repo because I wanted to be able to easily install this package with pip. You can do so too with 

`pip install git+https://github.com/AtomScott/Combinatorics.git`

Found this but it looks broken, 
https://pypi.org/project/Combinatorics/ .

## Example

```python
import Combinatorics

Combinatorics.prod(range(1,11))
>>>3628800
```

## Maintenence
I have no intent to maintain this project so anyone can feel free to take over. Although, if there are any PRs I will probably have a look at them.
